# MovieLens Project

This project completes part of the final assessment in HarvardX's Professional Certificate in Data Science. It explores the MovieLens data set, focusing on the construction of models used to predict whether a person will suffer from fatal heart failure upon next visit.


## Graded Files

### `main_code.R`
This is the main R script which constructs the data and calculates predictions and RMSE results for each model. This script also creates some basic plots for data exploration, illustrated in the final report. 

### `movielens_project.rmd`
This is the final report in .Rmd form. The files loaded are created in `main_code.R`. All of the R objects required to run `movielens_project.Rmd` are included in the folder `rmd_files`.  This folder must be present in the working directory (relative paths in line with this repo are used).

### `heart_failure_project.pdf`
The final report in PDF format.
